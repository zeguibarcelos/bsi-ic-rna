# Artificial Neural Network Implementation — Perceptron

This repository presents the implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network of the Single-Layer Perceptron type**, developed as an academic assignment for the **Computational Intelligence** course in the **Bachelor’s Degree in Information Systems**.

The project consists of creating a **C++ class** responsible for performing the **weight adjustment (training) process** based on the classical **Perceptron model**, applying fundamental concepts of **supervised learning**.
